<h3>The Collector</h3>
<p>This is such a great horror movie, <br>because it has alot of scarying scenes.</p>

<h3> The Matrix </h3>
<p> 
    I love the Matrix series of Movies, <br/> 
    Beacuse it has a mix of fiction <br/>
    and our own reality and it shows how programmed <br/>
    ebverybody may be without notecing.
